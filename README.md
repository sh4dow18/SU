# Sh4dow18 Utilities for C++, Java and Python

# Overview
This project aims to help to do basic verifications in the programming languages ​​C++, Java and Python, this
so as not to have to create these verifications over and over again.

# Version
Version **1.0**

# Warning

It should be mentioned that the ID and phone number verifications were made with the Costa Rican format, in
addition, the email verification only works with the ".com" extension. These are templates, they can perfectly
be altered depending on what is needed.

# What is a Programming Language?

A programming language is a formal language that provides a programmer with the ability to write a series of
instructions so that a machine can understand and execute those instructions.

# What are C++, Java and Python?

C++ is a programming language whose intention of its creation was to extend the C programming language and the
mechanisms that allow the manipulation of objects.

Java is a programming language and a computing platform. There are many applications and websites that will
probably not work unless they have Java installed and more are being created every day. Java is fast, safe,
and reliable.

Python is an interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes the readability of its code. It is a
multi-paradigm programming language, since it partially supports object-orientation, imperative programming
and functional programming.

# Using SU

To use the Sh4dow Utilities, the file corresponding to the language in which it is being programmed must be
added. For C++, the '.h' is used, in Java it is the '.java' and in Python it would be '.py'. Subsequently,
you must create a program object and use it whenever you need it.

This is all the documentation for now. Eat vegetables and have a good day.
